Config.js - a JavaScript cofiguration library

Config.js allows developers to configure their applications in an XML block
instead of hard-coding values inside their scripts or in JSON objects.  The
XML can be embedded inside an HTML document or in a separate XML file.  The
configuration block may contain strings, numbers, arrays and HTML.
Furthermore, variables can be inserted into these values, allowing
developers to use the XML block as a simple templating system for their
applications.
