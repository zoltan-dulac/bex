			up hope on meeting “my guy”. Thankfully some very pushy and persuasive family and friends 
			
			convinced me to give internet dating a try. I’m obviously now very thankful to them for this, 
			
			or I would never have met my wonderful, handsome, thoughtful, witty, family oriented, Habs 
			
			loving, Irish-French Canadian from Mississauga. I feel like I’ve known Jods all my life and 
			
			that my heart has truly found a home...finally! =) While we are very different in many 
			
			ways, we are similar where it counts and our differences make things interesting ;-) I’m so 
			
			excited &amp; happy to be marrying “my guy”, the amazing Jody Joseph Russell and can’t wait to 
			
			start our lives together.</p>

            <p>It's not every day you come across someone as
            wonderful as Rebecca. We have been together for over a
            year now. I knew from the moment I met Rebecca there
            was something special between us. Even though it was a
            slow dating process ;-) it grew into a wonderful
            relationship which lead me to known that Rebecca would
            be the one I asked to marry me. I have never cared so
            much for anyone as I do for Rebecca. Oct 12, 2014 will
            be another way for me to express how much I care for
            her and can’t wait to continue our life’s adventure as
            One. Watch out world as here comes team RODY!!!</p>

          drinking numerous coffees while career strategizing.
          Seventeen years later, we look back fondly on pool table
          parties, Niagara wine touring by bike, travels in South
          America and India and New York, disastrous cupcake
          incidents, six crazy weeks of improv classes, and some

          	Suma to be a close friend who not so subtly applied 
          	considerable pressure for Rebecca to try internet 
          	dating and even threatened to go online and impersonate

considers him a true friend that “I can call my brother”. They are both diehard sport fans and 
share their mutual passion for the Montreal Canadiens [Go Habs Go!!!]. Jody also says that he 
is eagerly awaiting their much talked about baseball tribute road trip to Chicago [Wrigley Field]

          	of Montreal and has known him for more than 40 years.  
          	They grew up playing hockey together and bonded over 
          	their mutual passion for sports.  Their families were

          <p>Terry is Jody’s cousin on his father’s side of the family.
			Terry kind-heartedly opened his home to Jody when he 
			first moved to Toronto and allowed Jody to live with 
			him and his young daughter Dawn, for almost 7 years.  
			This was home away from home for Jody and made his 
			transition from a Montrealer to a Torontonian [although 
			he’ll always be a montrealer at heart] much easier.  
			Terry became like a second father to him.  Jody 
			will always cherish the late night chats, helpful 
			tax tips and many hours of socializing over a glass 
			or two of rye and ginger!</p>

            and Indian Grove Rd. There is free street parking on
            the residential streets surrounding the church. There
            is also a TTC parking lot at the bottom of Indian Grove
            Rd., near Bloor St [the Keele Subway stop] which is
            free on weekends and a quick 4 minute walk Northwards
            to the church. The lot can only be accessed from Indian
            Rd., which runs north from Bloor St. and is parallel to
            Indian Grove Rd. [see map provided]. There is however a
            convenient paved foot path from the parking lot to
            Indian Grove Rd.</p><iframe src=
